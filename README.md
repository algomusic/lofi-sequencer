A simple DIY generative sequencer based on an ESP32 and a lasercut enclosure.

The LoFi Generative Sequencer is a self-contained, DIY electronic musical instrument. It is battery-powered, with a built-in loudspeaker and headphone output, and driven by an ESP32 microcontroller. It can generate and playback repeated monophonic musical patterns up to 16 steps in length.
